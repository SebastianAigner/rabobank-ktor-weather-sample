# Ktor Weather sample

This "should-we-barbecue" microservice was created during a live coding session for Rabobank.

## How to run
From the terminal:
```
./gradlew run
```

...or from the IDE by navigating to `Application.kt` and running the `main` function. 

You can then reach its API at `localhost:8080/api/bbq?city=Amsterdam`
